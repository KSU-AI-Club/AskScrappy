# AskScrappy
The goal of AskScrappy is to help improve the mental health of KSU students by providing accurate, relevant, and personalized advising throughout their college journeys. 
Scrappy will provide students with access to an advisor that is helpful and thoughtful, on the students' own schedules. Scrappy will help students plan out their classes most efficiently by referencing up-to-date curricula, cross-referencing RateMyProfessor reviews, and taking into account a student's previously taken courses and urgency to graduate/pain tolerance tradeoff.
